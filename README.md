# Fall-Detection
Fall Detection for Elderly using Surveillance Cameras  



## Introduction 
Immediate medical attention for senior citizens is a matter of utmost urgency. They end up meeting with small accidents because their body sometimes fails to support them. Many times, the family members are not even aware of these happenings until very late. The proposed system aims at reducing the time taken to attend the comatose person by using keypoint detection which detects different poses. Upon detection of a  fall, the system not only will alert the kin and hospital for immediate medical attention; but also send the location of the person and an emergency SOS.
